## Phase 2: User-Centered Design

### Executive Summary:
  
For this deliverable, we created a model application for the use of our product the "parcel protector". We drew inspiration from other simple phone applications that are made to assist a device. We created a wireframe of all the app pages then used the prototype feature in adobe XD to make them all path together seamlessly. After this, we created this .md file to explain our thought process when making these app pages.

| LOGIN | CREATE | DELIVERY |
| Here, we use a standard enter username and password buttons in order to prompt the user to enter their account creditentials. This is a simple and concise layout that matches many user's mental models of login pages. | This allows users to create their own accounts to link their specific box to their app. This screen uses the convention where the user enters their email, username, and password and creates the account using a button towards the bottom of the screen. We chose this convention as it is common  and many users may have already built a mental model of the screen. | This allows a user to see which deliveries have been placed in their box. It knows when a delivery has been made due to the pressure plate at the bottom of the parcel protector. We chose to create a page using a form of list layout so that users can distinguish which packages have been delivered based their weight and the dates that they were delivered on. |

| HOME-SCREEN-UNLOCK | HOME-SCREEN-LOCK | PERMA-LOCK |
| (inspired by in-class discussion/critique of our wireframe prototype) This signifies the status of the parcel protector with the large lock icon and prompts the user to tap the lock in order to unlock the parcel protector with the app when nearby the box. | (inspired by in-class discussion/critique of our wireframe prototype) This signifies the status of the parcel protector with the large unlock icon and prompts the user to tap the lock in order to lock down the parcel protector with the app when nearby the box. | (inspired by the persona Jessica Wroblewski) This allows for the users to permanently enable the lock for a desired duration. Perfect for vacations! |

| LINKING WIFI AND SCANNING QR | LINKING WIFI | SCAN QR | 
| (inspired by in-class discussion/critique of our wireframe prototype) This page sets up the parcel protector via a linking qr code and wifi. This allows the parcel protector to retreive information such as time of delivery and send information such as notifications to the user. We chose to create two buttons to accomplish this, along with a message at the top to notify the user what needs to be done. This is so users can choose which task they would like to do first. | (inspired by in-class discussion/critique of our wireframe prototype) This goes in-depth and allows the user to enter their wifi id and password in order to link their parcel protector to their personal wifi network. We went with the common enter the wifi SSID and password as that is a common convention used when logging into a wifi network. | (inspired by in-class discussion/critique of our wireframe prototype) This links the parcel protector to a specific account via a scannable qr code that is provided on the receipt. The account has the ability to permit other users to have access to their parcel protector. We chose to use most of this screen to allow the user to see what their mobile device's camera sees so that they can effectively align the camera with the qr code.  |

| SETTINGS | USER ACCOUNT | 
| (inspired by in-class discussion/critique of our wireframe prototype) This allows for a user to customize their notification experience with their box as well as providing the option to perma-lock their box for a specified period of time. Here, we use toggle switches to toggle a notification feature or the permanent lock feature as the toggle switches are easily learnable and signify the status of those features. | (inspired by in-class discussion/critique of our wireframe prototype) This allows a user to monitor delivery history and change their password. We chose to place our delivery history in this screen so that a user can view all the deliveries made to their box specific to their account. | |
