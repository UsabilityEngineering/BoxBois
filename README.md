# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering


### Executive Summary
- Investigated user experiences with porch pirates to see who is most affected and which areas are most affected by porch pirates
   - Found that a majority (43.5%) of the individuals, aged **21 to 24 years of age**, live in **apartments or condominiums**.
- **Almost half** (60.9% combined) of the surveyed individuals **know victims** (43.5%) or **have been victimized by a porch pirate** (17.4%).
- **Online survey** of individuals (n=24) with different backgrounds and living situations within a Chico state class session gathered peopleâ€™s experiences with porch pirates and potential interest in the product.
- Found that a majority (69.6%) of surveyed individuals **order smaller packages, comparable to a small novel**.
- The average number of hours **people spend outside** of their houses ranges from **1-3 hours**, but around **62.5%** of survey takers specified that they are **not worried** about porch pirates.
- **Designed personas and scenarios** to represent a victim and a porch pirate experience with the product:
   - Jessica: social media influencer who gets products shipped to her doorstep so that she can make a review on them, but is usually busy creating videos that sometimes take her outside of the house.
   - Sean Hanson: a 36 year-old stay-at-home father of four. Constantly orders groceries to his house in order to feed his family. Sean tends to his needy children therefore he cannot retrieve packages whenever they are delivered.
