# Personas

## Jessica Wroblewski

Jessica Wroblewski is a 24 year-old media influencer with a following of over 1 million. She strictly shops online and lives in a single-family town-house with a roommate. With Jessica being an online influencer, she receives up to five packages shipped to her doorstep weekly. She spends four to five hours outside making content at important events in order to promote her social media persona, so she never knows when a package has arrived.   

## Sean Hanson
Sean Hanson is a 36 year-old stay-at-home father of four: Ed, Chris, Frankie, and Karl, whose ages range from three to seven years old. He lives in a town-house located next to the largest wildlife park reservation in the state. Since his wife, Shannon Hanson, is constantly busy at work, he constantly orders groceries to his house in order to feed his family. Most of the time, Sean is tending to his four needy children and cannot retrieve packages whenever they are delivered.  

# Scenarios

## Jessica's roommate is a porch pirate

Jessica's roommate, Sarah, also has a social media account. However, Sarah's account is not nearly as popular as Jessica's. Because of this, Sarah takes a package from the doorstep each week in spite of Jessica. Jessica notices that some of her packages are missing every week, and has to email the organizations that sent her the product, asking for a replacement item. This causes her social media prowess to deteriorate as she cannot create content as rapidly as she was before.    

## Sean's grocery grubbers

Sean is currently entertaining his four young children when the doorbell rings. The groceries have arrived, but he cannot answer it immediately as his youngest child, Ed is attempting to eat a bottle cap. The delivery person has delivered to this house before and has waited for long periods of time before, so he leaves. Now that the groceries are unprotected, critters from the wildlife park reservation decide it is safe enough to investigate the grocery bag and steal many of its contents. Sean finally comes outside ten minutes after the doorbell rings to see his ransacked grocery bags and shoos the remaining critters away.
