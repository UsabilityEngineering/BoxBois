# Scenarios

## Jessica's roomate is a porch pirate

With Jessica being an online influencer she gets tons of packages shipped to her doorstep weekly. She is always making content near scenic views so she never knows when a package has arrived. Her roomate takes a package from the doorstep each week in spite of Jessica. Jessica now knows her roomate is the porch pirate but does not know how to protect her package deliveries. She finds out about a parcel protector box from "Box Bois" and buys one immediately. With the 'Box Bois' parcel protector Jessica is now the only person with access to her packages keeping her online deliveries safe. Her roomate was upset and moved out.   

## Niko's first encounter with a Box Bois parcel protector

Niko lives in the outskirts of the city but he is also very close to inner city where most apartment complexes are. Niko usually steals packages from the outskirts first then moves onto the apartment complexes for more looting. He then sells all his findings at the pawn shop and calls it a day. All of the people living in the outskirt were fed up with their packages getting randomly stolen still not knowing who was to blame. They searched online how to protect their deliveries, most came across the Box Bois parcel protection box and bought one right away. Niko spots a UPS truck and follows it to its destination, he sees the package being dropped into a box with a "Box Bois" logo on it. As soon as the driver leaves Niko goes in for the loot. The Box Bois parcel protector has a scale at the bottom which immediately locks the whole box once the package is dropped in there. Niko does not know this and keeps trying to open it by bashing it and trying to pry it open but the box is impenetrable. He then sees that all of the houses in the outskirts now have the same box on their porch. He leaves and cries, he hasn't stolen anything since.
