## Jessica's roomate is a porch pirate

With Jessica being an online influencer she gets tons of packages shipped to her doorstep weekly. Her roomate takes a package from the doorstep each week in spite of Jessica. Jessica now knows her roomate is the porch pirate but does not know how to protect her package deliveries. She finds out about a parcel protector box from "Box Bois" and buys one immediately. With the 'Box Bois' parcel protector Jessica is now the only person with access to her packages keeping her online deliveries safe. Her roomate was upset and moved out.
