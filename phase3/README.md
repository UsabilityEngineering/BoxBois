### Background 
The background questions will aid us in discovering whether the user would ever be interested in purchasing our product.     


### Task 1   
Task 1 focuses on setting up a user account via a phone application. After that account has been set up, we then tell them to link the parcel protector box to their account.  
With the feedback we recieve it will help us figure out how well the flow of our application flow is, as well as what accommodations need to be met for a smoother experience to first time users. 

### Task 2
Our second task highlights how a user would allow another trusted user access to their parcel protector box. From that point forward the task gauges how effective the app is at helping a user find previous deliveries.   
The feedback we recieve will show how efficient finding previous deliveries is, but also will let us know if adding a trusted user is a learnable step to first time users. 

### Task 3
The final task we have set up is to find out the user's mental model of our parcel protector. The model we showcase to the users is intended to ensure users can successfully distinguish each aspect of the parcel protector. Such as the LEDs that will be displayed and the hatches found on the parcel protector box.    
With the responses we recieve it will help us determine if changes should be made towards the parcel protector model. It will also let us know if a section of the model does not make sense to first time users, allowing us to alter the model to be a smoother first time experience.

### Wrap-Up || Overall approach
For our study we decided to take both a formative and summative approach alternating between the two depending on the task at hand. Our first two tasks are summative as they consist of the users using our model phone application to accomplish a goal from A to B. For our last task we used a formative approach ,and think-aloud, as we ask the user to describe and elaborate on the model/design of our parcel protector box.
